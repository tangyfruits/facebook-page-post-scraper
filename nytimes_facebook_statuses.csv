The film is ""an absolute delight — funny and charming, fast-moving and full of surprises. It is also a defense of sorrow, an argument for the necessity of melancholy dressed in the bright colors of entertainment. The youngest viewers will have a blast, while those older than Riley are likely to find themselves in tears. Not of grief, but of gratitude and recognition. Sadness, it turns out, is not Joy’s rival but her partner. Our ability to feel sad is what stirs compassion in others and empathy in ourselves. There is no growth without loss, and no art without longing.""","Review: Pixar’s ‘Inside Out’ Finds the Joy in Sadness, and Vice Versa",link,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/movies/review-pixars-inside-out-finds-the-joy-in-sadness-and-vice-versa.html,2015-06-18 10:45:00,6734,181,1312

Q. How was your meeting with the prime minister?
A. It was good. The prime minister was well informed. He listened to what I said. It was an honor for me to meet the prime minister. We spoke about what happened and he gave his support to me and my family.

Q. What did you say to him?
A. I told the prime minister he must work to end racism and discrimination. We dreamed for so many years to come to Israel. He must work to solve the problem.

Q. How do you feel about Sunday’s protest?
A. On the one hand I feel sad that it descended into violence. On the other hand I support the demonstrators. I could not be with them physically because I am a soldier. I am against violence, but my heart is with them.

Q. Can you describe what happened to you the day you were beaten?
A. It was about 6.30 in the evening. I was on my way home from the army. The police officer told me to turn around and go. He didn’t say why. There was a suspicious object (Israeli term for a suspected bomb) on the road, but I did not know. I wanted to get home as quickly as possible. I got off my bicycle and waited for the police officer to finish speaking on his cellphone so that I could pass. Then he threw down my cellphone and bike and started pushing me. When I asked why he was pushing me he started hitting me in the face.

Q. How do you feel about becoming a symbol or a hero?
A. I don’t see myself as a symbol or hero. It just happened to me.
